	<h1> Intro to Blox Fruits </h1>

	<p> Blox Fruits is a game play by millions of people and has become very popular. In blox fruits you
	need to take quests for your level and defeat the required amount of enemies. You can get different
	fighting styles and the fighting styles are combat, dark step, electric, water kung-fu, dragons breath,
	super human, death step, electric claw, sharkman karate, dragon talon, god human, and sanguine
	art. There are different requirements for each fighting style. Some fighting styles are only
	available in the first sea, second sea, or third sea. </p>

	<h2> Blox Fruits swords </h2>

	<p> In Blox Fruits there are also different swords you can get. Some are only available in the first
	sea such as the katana, cutlass, dual katana, pipe, triple katana, dual headed blade, soul cane, and
	saber which can be upgraded to v2 and is widely considered the best sword in the first sea. In the
	second sea you can try to find the legendary sword dealer which sells three different swords each
	costing $2 million, if you get all three swords you can craft it into the triple true katana known
	as the TTK for $2 million. Another sword you can get in the second sea is the midnight blade which
	you can buy from El_Admin who is located in the cursed ship next to graveyard, you can buy the midnight
	blade from El_Admin for 100 ectoplasm. </p>

	<h2> Fruits </h2>

	<p> There are 4 main ways to deal damage two of which I went over, they include fighting styles,
	swords, guns, and fruits. I will not be going over the guns because nobody uses them and
	it's not school appropriate. Fruits are the fourth main way to deal damage and can be bought
	from the blox fruits dealer, if you buy a fruit from the dealer it will not be a physical
	fruit and you will automatically equip it. The dealer will sell random fruits and the fruits
	reset every 4 hours, rocket and spin are always in stock. Another way to get blox fruits is
	to spin a random fruit, you can spin a fruit from Zioles. If you spin a fruit you will get
	a random physical fruit meaning it will appear in your inventory and you can eat it, store
	it, or drop it. If you eat it you will equip the fruit you were holding and lose your
	current fruit. If you store it it will be in your inventory and you will no longer be
	able to drop it. If you drop it the fruit you are holding will drop on the ground and
	any player including you will be able to pick it up, if you pick up a fruit off the ground it
	will appear in your inventory as a physical fruit. You need to be level 50 to spin a fruit and
	it costs a certain amount of money depending on your level, and you can only spin every 2 hours. </p>
